### Inventory Application
> Personal project to build an inventory tracking application for a home business. 

* Thoughts were to go entirely serverless which is always a great idea until you actually have to implement it.

* Initial implementation will be Node/express back end. Might hook up DynamoDB instead of mongo to make conversion to serverless later down the track a bit easier. 

* Front-end decision between React or Vue. 

* Stack to be hosted on AWS eventually but possibly use heroku for short-term prototyping.

* Will be a limited user base but am interested in using oauth as I've never used it before and am keen to learn.
